# txii
*(this name is just a short placeholder)*

We're trying to make a single open-source/open-hardware module that functions as both an updated version of the [telex txi](https://github.com/bpcmusic/telex) and as an expander for a commercial module that we are making, Time Machine. That's why files still have "TM" in them.
